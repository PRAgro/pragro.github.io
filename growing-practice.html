                  >Fertilizer application methods play a crucial role in
                  enhancing plant growth and productivity. There are several
                  different methods of applying fertilizers, each with its own
                  advantages and benefits. Fertigation involves the application
                  of fertilizers through irrigation systems, allowing for
                  precise and efficient delivery of nutrients directly to the
                  plant roots. Foliar application involves spraying fertilizers
                  directly onto the leaves, where they are absorbed by the plant
                  for quick results. Controlled-release fertilizers (CRF) slowly
                  release nutrients over time, providing a steady supply to the
                  plants. Soil application is done by incorporating fertilizers
                  into the soil, ensuring that the nutrients are available to
                  the plants as they grow. Each method has its unique benefits
                  and can be chosen based on the specific needs of the crops and
                  soil conditions to optimize growth and yield.</i

                        concern in the world. Agriculture segment is the largest
                        user of water, and has the target to enhance
                        water-use-efficiency. Nutrigation technology allows a
                        better use of water. Micro-irrigation systems have been
                        developed, and provide a better water-use-efficiency of
                        between 80% to 90 % with Drip System, while other
                        irrigation practices only have a 40-50 %
                        water-use-efficiency. Drip irrigation places the water
                        close to the roots. This reduces the volume of watered
                        soil and the water loss by evaporation. In the past 20
                        years, the acreage under drip irrigation has grown
                        substantially and is growing.</span

                    prior to application, and injected into the irrigation water

                    systems are sensitive to clogging, therefore mineral
                    particles e.g. from incompletely dissolved fertilizers,
                    precipitation or microbial growth have to be avoided and the
                    fertilizers, either in solid or liquid form, as straights or
                    ready-made mixtures have to be completely water

                    it is crucial to ensure optimum growth conditions in terms
                    of nutrient and water supply. In order to avoid salinity
                    problems, nutrigation should use fertilizers, like calcium
                    nitrate, potassium nitrate etc., which do not contain any
                    other elements that are not necessary for the nutrition of

                    available form can be placed close to the roots in required
                    rates when needed. As crops require different rates of each
                    nutrient at specific physiological growth stages,
                    nutrigation enables the grower to increase yield and fine

                    fertilizer-use-efficiency. The yield increase in nutrigation
                    systems is in line with the need to intensify
                    land-use-efficiency to meet the food demand of the growing
                    population by production on a shrinking acreage of available
                    arable land. Furthermore, the higher nutrient-use-efficiency
                    is of advantage for the environment, as nutrients used by
                    the crop are not lost by leaching or gaseous losses
                    (volatilization).</span

                    >The predominant route for nutrients to enter plant tissue
                    is via uptake through the roots. However, there are many
                    situations where nutrition through leaves, fruit or shoots
                    can be a very effective complementary delivery system.
                    Leaves are not ideal for water and nutrient uptake, because
                    their architecture is to protect crops against water loss as
                    well as fungi and pest attack. The cuticle, (the outer cell
                    layer on leaves sealed with wax) works as a barrier to the
                    entrance of nutrients into the plant. However, nutrients in
                    the ionic form can penetrate either through the cuticle via
                    small cracks or through the stomata, the pores in leaves for
                    gas exchange.</span

                  becomes a bottleneck of production since vital metabolic
                  pathways are impaired. As a consequence, shape and color of
                  crops deviates from those fully nourished. Visual symptoms can
                  tell an experienced grower which nutrient is lacking. Foliar
                  application of the nutrient concerned will provide an
                  immediate relief of the problem and a normal crop yield can be

                  are applied to treat latent deficiencies (hidden hunger). The
                  need for such treatments is determined by a chemical analysis
                  of the crop. For almost all crops critical nutrient values are
                  available which indicate the adequate nutrient content in the
                  tissue. If the analysis for a particular nutrient is below its
                  critical value, foliar nutrition can be made to prevent the
                  problem. Yield responses to foliar nutrition can be

                  of nutrients applied. Efficiency of the foliar fertilizer is
                  improved when the formulation contains additives like wetting
                  agents to enhance the coverage of leaves or stickers that
