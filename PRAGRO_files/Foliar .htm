							  <span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Role of foliar 
							  nutrition in plants</span> <br>

							  The predominant route for nutrients to enter plant tissue is via uptake 
							  through the roots. However, there are many situations where nutrition 
							  through leaves, fruit or shoots can be a very
						effective
						complementary delivery system. Leaves are not ideal for water
						and nutrient uptake, because
						their architecture is to protect crops against water loss as well as
						fungi and
						pest attack. The cuticle, (the outer cell layer on leaves sealed with
						wax)
						works as a barrier to the entrance of nutrients into the plant. However, nutrients in the
						ionic form can
						penetrate either through the cuticle via small cracks or through the stomata,
						the pores
								in leaves for gas exchange.</span></p>

							  <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
							  <span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-weight: normal;"><br>

							  Foliar applications can be done&nbsp; either with aqueous solutions or suspension of 
							  nutrients. Application rates are low, 0.5 to 10 kilograms of foliar 
							  fertilizer per hectare, dissolved in 50 â€“ 2500 liters of water. The water 
							  rate depends on canopy size and density. Foliar fertilizers are
						often used
						to supplement micronutrients (Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu, B, Mo) and occasionally the 
							  secondary (Ca, Mg, S) and Primary nutrients (N, P, K)<br>

							<br>

							  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Foliar application to treat
						absolute deficiency</span> <br>

						All nutrients play an essential
						role for growth and development
						of crops. The shortage of a single nutrient becomes a bottleneck of
						production
						since vital metabolic pathways are impaired. As a consequence, shape and color of crops deviates from those fully nourished. 
							  Visual symptoms can tell an
						experienced grower which
						nutrient is lacking. Foliar application of the nutrient concerned will
						provide
						an immediate relief of the problem and a normal crop yield can be
						achieved.<br>

							  <br>

						Sometimes there are no visible
						symptoms, but foliar sprays
						are applied to treat latent deficiencies (hidden hunger). The need for
						such
						treatments is determined by a chemical analysis of the crop. For almost
						all
						crops critical nutrient values are available which indicate the
						adequate
						nutrient content in the tissue. If the analysis for a particular
						nutrient is
						below its critical value, foliar nutrition can be made to prevent
						the
						problem. Yield responses to foliar nutrition can be substantial.<br>

							  <br>

							  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Foliar nutrition to prevent deficiencies in fruits</span> <br>

						Nutrient availability is not
						the only bottleneck for
						adequate nutrient supply to crops. Limited nutrient transport to
						different
						plant parts can also cause localized deficiencies. In particular the
						transport
						of boron and calcium in the plant relies on the transpiration flow,
						which means
						that tissue with low transpiration rates, eg. Fruit, can easily become
						deficient in calcium and boron.<br>

						<br>

						<span style="font-weight: bold;">Efficient foliar fertilizers</span><br>

						Efficiency of foliar
						applications depends on crop type, leaf
						coverage, weather conditions and product quality. It is estimated that
						foliar
						treated crops will absorb about 15 &ndash; 40% of nutrients
						applied. Efficiency of
						the foliar fertilizer is improved when the formulation contains
						additives like
						wetting agents to enhance the coverage of leaves or stickers that
						prevent
						nutrients being washed off by rainfall.

						partners<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Haifa chemicals Ltd., Nouryon Functional Chemicals B.V(formerly known as Akzo-Nobel), Yara
