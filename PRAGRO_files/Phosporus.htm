							  Phosphorus (P) In Plants </font></span></p>
							  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 3px; "><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">
							  Phosphorus is an essential nutrient both as a part of several key plant 
							  structure compounds and as a catalyst in the conversion of numerous key 
							  biochemical reactions in plants. Phosphorus is noted especially for its 
							  role in capturing and converting the sunâ€™s energy into useful plant 
							  compounds. The two examples that follow illustrate how vital phosphorus 
							  nutrition is to normal plant development and production. Phosphorus is a 
							  vital component of DNA, the genetic &quot;memory unit&quot; of all living things. It 
							  is also a component of RNA, the compound that reads the DNA genetic code 
							  to build proteins and other compounds essential for plant structure, seed 
							  yield, and genetic transfer. The structures of both DNA and RNA are linked 
							  together by phosphorus bonds. <br>
							  Phosphorus is a vital component of ATP, the &quot;energy unit&quot; of plants. ATP 
							  forms during photosynthesis, has phosphorus in its structure, and 
							  processes from the beginning of seedling growth through to the formation 
							  of grain and maturity Thus phosphorus is essential for the general health 
							  and vigor of all plants. Some specific growth factors that have been 
							  associated with phosphorus are: stimulated root development, increased 
							  stalk and stem strength, improved flower formation and seed production, 
							  more uniform and earlier crop maturity, increased nitrogen N-fixing 
							  capacity of legumes, improvements in crop quality, and increased 
							  resistance to plant diseases.\

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 3px;">
							<span style="font-size: 9pt">Phosphorus deficiency is more difficult to 
							  diagnose than a deficiency of nitrogen or potassium. Crops usually display 
							  no obvious symptoms of phosphorus deficiency, other than a general 
							  stunting of the plant during early growth, and by the time a visual 
							  deficiency is recognized it may be too late to correct in annual crops. 
							  Some crops, such as corn, tend to show an abnormal discoloration when 
							  phosphorus is deficient. The plants are usually dark bluish-green in color 
							  with leaves and stem becoming purplish. The degree of purple is influenced 
							  by the genetic makeup of the plant, some hybrids showing much greater 
							  discoloration than others. The purplish color is due to accumulation of 
							  sugars which favors the synthesis of anthocyanin (a purplish colored 
							  pigment) that occurs in the leaves of the plant. Phosphorus is highly 
							  mobile in plants and when deficient it may be translocated from old plant 
							  tissue to young actively growing areas. Consequently, early vegetative 
							  responses to phosphorus are often observed. As a plant matures, phosphorus 
							  is translocated into the fruiting areas of the plant where high energy 
							  requirements are needed for the formation of seeds and fruit. Phosphorus 
							  deficiencies late in the growing season affect both seed development and 
							  normal crop maturity. The percentage of the total amount of each nutrient 
							  taken up is higher for phosphorus late in the growing season than for 
							  either nitrogen or potassium.

							<font size="2">Soil Phosphorus Availability </font></b>
							<span style="font-size: 9pt"><br>
							  Soluble phosphorus, either from fertilizer or natural weathering, reacts 
							  with clay, iron, and <br>
							  aluminum compounds in the soil and is converted readily to less available 
							  forms by the process of phosphorus fixation. Because of these fixation 
							  processes, phosphorus moves very little in most soils (less than an inch 
							  in most soils), stays close to its place of origin, and crops seldom 
							  absorb more than 20 percent of fertilizer phosphorus during the first 
							  cropping season after application. As a result, little soil phosphorus is 
							  lost by leaching. This fixed, residual phosphorus remains in the rooting 
							  zone and will be slowly available to succeeding crops. Soil erosion and 
							  crop removal are the significant ways soil phosphorus is lost. </span></p>
