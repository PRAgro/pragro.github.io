						<font size="2">Magnesium is required for crops to
						capture the sun's energy for growth and production. Chlorophyll, the
						green pigment in plants, is the site where photosynthesis
						occurs without chlorophyll plants could not manufacture food.
						Magnesium
						is an essential component of the chlorophyll molecule, with each
						molecule containing 6.7 percent magnesium. &nbsp;Its functions
						include phosphate metabolism, plant respiration, and activation of
						enzyme systems.&nbsp; Availability of Mg is often related to soil
						pH. Other situations also increase needs for Mg: sandy soils with low cation exchange capacity, low Mg-supplying power, and a high Mg
						leaching potential; application of calcitic limestone on low Mg soils;
						crops with high Mg requirements; high application rates of ammonium-N
						and K; soil test levels below 50 to 100 lb/A exchangeable Mg.</font>
							  <h3> <font size="2">Plant Deficiency Symptoms</font></h3>

							  <font size="2">Magnesium is taken up by the plant as
						the divalent cation, Mg++. It is
						mobile within the plant and easily translocated from older to younger
						tissues. When deficiencies occur, the older leaves are affected first.
						The deficiency symptoms may include the following: (1) loss of color
						between the leaf veins, beginning at the leaf margins or tips and
						progressing inward. This can give the leaves a striped appearance. (2)
						Leaves may become brittle and cup or curve upward and they may become
						thinner than normal. (3) Tips and edges of leaves may become
						reddish-purple in cases of severe deficiency (especially with cotton).
						(4) Low leaf Mg can lead to lowered photosynthesis and overall crop
						stunting.</font><p>

							  <font size="2"><br>

						As a rule of thumb, most crops have a critical plant tissue Mg
						concentration of about 0.2 percent. Some species have a higher total
						requirement than others: forage legumes and grasses, cotton, oil palm,
						corn, potatoes, citrus, sugar beets and tobacco need lots of Mg. Some
						varieties and hybrids of crops such as corn, soybeans, cotton and
						celery may require more Mg than others.</font></p>
							  <p>

							  <font size="2"><br>

						If Mg deficiencies are detected in growing crops through plant tissue
						analysis, a soluble magnesium source may be applied and watered into
						the soil by irrigation or rainfall. This will permit root access and
						plant uptake. Small amounts of Mg can also be applied to growing crops
						through foliar fertilization to correct or prevent developing
						deficiencies. The preferred approach is to soil apply the required
						amounts of Mg before crops are planted or before they begin active
						growth.</font>
