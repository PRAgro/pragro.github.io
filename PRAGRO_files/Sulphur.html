					<td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: justify;"><font size="2">In India sulphur is
						becoming more of a limiting nutrient in crop production than in the
						past, for several reasons: higher crop yields
						require more S; increased use of high analysis fertilizers containing
						little or no S; reduced amounts of atmospheric S fallout from the sky;
						and reduced soil S reserves from organic matter losses due to
						mineralization and erosion. Most S in the soil is tied up in organic
						matter and cannot be used by the plant until it is converted to the
						sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub>) form by soil bacteria, which is
						known as
						mineralization. Sulphur can be applied as broadcast or banded
						fertilizer
						material or applied through irrigation systems (furrow and sprinkler).
						Sulphur is also an important nutrient for proper nutrition of forage
						crops that will be consumed by livestock.</font>
						<h3>Sulphur&nbsp;in Plants and Sulphur Deficiency </h3>

						<br>

						<p><font size="2">As mentioned above, Sulphur is absorbed primarily in the
						sulfate form
						(SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup>) by plants. It may
						also enter the leaves of plants from the air
						as sulphur dioxide(SO<sub>2</sub>) gas. It is part of every
						living cell and required
						for synthesis of certain amino acids (cysteine and methionine) and
						proteins. Sulphur is also important for photosynthesis and crop winter
						hardiness. Leguminous plants need sulphur for&nbsp; efficient
						nitrogen
						fixation. Sulphur is also important in the nitrate-reductase process
						where nitrate-nitrogen is converted to amino acids.&nbsp;</font></p>

						<p><font size="2">In the field, sulphur
						deficiency and nitrogen deficiency are often
						easily confused. Symptoms of both deficiencies may appear as stunted
						plants, with a general yellowing of leaves. Sulphur is immobile within
						the plant and does not readily move from old to new growth. With
						sulphur deficiency, yellowing symptoms often first appear in younger
						leaves, whereas with nitrogen deficiency, the yellowing appears on the
						older leaves first. In less severe situations, visual symptoms may not
						be noticeable.&nbsp;</font></p>

						<p><font size="2">The best way to diagnose a
						deficiency is with a plant tissue analysis
						that includes an assay for both sulphur and nitrogen. sulphur
						concentrations in most plants should range from about 0.2 to 0.5
						percent. Desirable total nitrogen to total sulphur ratios have been
						considered and range from 7:1 to 15:1. Wider ratios may point to
						possible sulphur deficiency but should be considered along with actual
						N and S concentrations in making diagnostic interpretations.&nbsp;</font></p>

						<p><font size="2">When sulphur is deficient,
						nitrate-nitrogen may accumulate. This can
						pose significant health threats to grazing ruminants or those consuming
						hay high in nitrates. When nitrates accumulate in the plant, seed
						formation can be inhibited in some crops such as Canola. Balancing
						sulphur with nitrogen nutrition is important to both plant and animal
						health. Crops such as hybrid bermudagrass, alfalfa and corn that have a
						high dry matter production generally require the greatest amount of
						sulphur. Also, potato and many other vegetables require large amounts
						of S and have produced best when S is included in the fertilization
						program. Without adequate S fertilization, crops that receive high
						rates of nitrogen may develop sulphur deficiencies. </font></p>

						<h3><font size="2">Calcium, Magnesium and
						Sulphur Recommendations </font> </h3>

						<p> <font size="2">Generally, Sulphur and
						magnesium
						recommendations vary from state to
						state. They range from no recommendation to a blanket recommendation
						from 10-30 Kg/Ha.
						Most states depend on soil test results for making magnesium
						recommendations and a blanket recommendation for Sulphur by crops. </font></p>

						<p> <font size="2"> <br>

						It should be emphasized that yield goal, soil types and soil and plant
						analysis results should be considered in making calcium, magnesium and
						Sulphur recommendations.
						Adequate supplies of all essential plant nutrients are essential for
						high crop yields and profits. We should not allow calcium, magnesium
						and Sulphur to be the limiting factors in achieving high, profitable
						crop
						yields.</font></p>
