							<font size="2">Calcium (Ca) is sometimes considered&nbsp;low key 
							  nutrient, but it carries a heavy load in plant growth. Calcium 
							  availability is adequate for most crops when soils are limed to properly 
							  adjust soil acidity. Deficiencies of Ca are most likely to occur on acid, 
							  sandy soils from which available Ca has been leached by rain or irrigation 
							  water, and on strongly acid peat soil where total soil Ca is low. 
							  High exchangeable
							  soil sodium (Na) may depress plant uptake of Ca.<br>
							<br>
							<b>Functions of Calcium in Soil </b> <br>
								In soil, calcium replaces hydrogen (H) ions from the surface of soil
								particles when limestone is added to reduce soil acidity. It is
								essential for microorganisms as they turn crop residues into organic
								matter, release nutrients, and improve soil aggregation and water
								holding capacity. Calcium helps enable nitrogen fixing bacteria that
								form nodules on the roots of leguminous plants to capture atmospheric
								nitrogen gas and convert into a form that plants can use. <br>
							<br>
							<b>Functions of Calcium in Plants </b> <br>
								Calcium improves the absorption of other nutrients by roots and their
								translocation within the plant. It activates a number of plant
								growth-regulating enzyme systems, helps convert nitrate-nitrogen into
								forms needed for protein formation, is needed for cell wall formation
								and normal cell division, and contributes to improved disease
								resistance. Calcium, along with magnesium and potassium, helps to
								neutralize organic acids, which form during cell metabolism in plants. (Ca) <br>
							<br>
							<b>Calcium Deficiency </b> <br>
							</font>
							<font size="2">Calcium deficiencies can occur and
								they need to be avoided or corrected. Symptoms of deficiency include:</font><br><ul><font size="2">
								<li> Slow root development. Roots may develop a dark color and in severe
								cases the growing point may die.</li></font><br><font size="2"> <li> New leaf growth may slow and leaf
								tips may stick together. Remember that calcium does not readily
								translocate within the plant so deficiency symptoms will appear on the
								new growth. </li></font><br><font size="2"><li> Poor nodulation by nitrogen fixing bacteria on
								leguminous plant roots. Ineffective nodules are white to grayish green
								inside while healthy nodules have dark pink interiors.</li></font><br><font size="2"> <li> Blossom end
								rot in tomatoes. Calcium and proper water management improve plant
								resistance to this problem. </li></font><br><font size="2"><li> Aborted and shriveled fruit on peanuts.
								A shortage of calcium at 
								"pegging" results in a high percentage of "pops". </li></font><br><font size="2"><li> Darkened plumule
								or "black heart" in peanut seed. This reduces yield, quality and crop
								value. </li></font><br><font size="2"><li> Pod rot diseases on peanuts. Pods are predisposed to fungus
								infections when calcium is deficient or out of balance with Mg and K.
								Calcium deficiencies are most likely to occur in acid, sandy soils from
								which calcium has been leached by rain or irrigation water. It may also
								occur in strongly acid peat and muck soils where total calcium is low.</li> </font><br>
